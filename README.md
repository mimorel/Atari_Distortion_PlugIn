# Atari_Distortion_PlugIn
This project is still in progress.

The project is inspired by a rumor that Crystal Castles replaced their synth sound card with an Atari sound chip. 

As I stated looking at the kinds of sounds that are produced by the Atari sound chip, specifically the Pokey sound chip, I learned that they were all square wave audio. And I thought it would be interesting to distort audio in the same way and see if it sounds more life the sounds produced by the Atari Sound chip. I think the most important qualities to the sound are the square wave and the focus on higher frequency sounds. Thus the project will do a square wave distortion and have a high-pass filter. 

For the project I am using Juce 7 and c++.

# Atari_Distortion_PlugIn



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project is inspired by a rumor that Crystal Castles replaced their synth sound card with an Atari sound chip. 

As I stated looking at the kinds of sounds that are produced by the Atari sound chip, specifically the POKEY sound chip, I learned that they were all square wave audio signals. And I thought it would be interesting to distort audio in the same way and see if it sounds more like the sounds produced by the Atari Sound chip, and Crystal Castles music. I think the most important qualities to the sound are the square wave and the focus on higher frequency sounds. Thus the project will apply square wave distortion and an optional high-pass filter to the given audio. The Plug-In is a VST3 plugin, able to be used in any DAW. It has been tested in Reaper.  

For the project I am using Juce 7 and C++.
